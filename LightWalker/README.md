LightWalker.ino
===============

The LightWalker sketch is compatible with both teensy 3.1 (maybe 3.0?) and an arduino mega 2560. At this point in time, you must also have the following libraries installed:
* [FastLED 2.1](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/tree/FastLED2.1) from the [FastLED guys](http://fastled.io)
* [i2c_t3](http://forum.pjrc.com/threads/21680-New-I2C-library-for-Teensy3) - only for the teensy build

Hardware setup can _sort of_ be found in the two fritzing files included in the repo although they're a bit weird.
